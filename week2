When declaring resources initially, we type the resource type in lowercase. 
When we reference a resource relationship from another file, we capitalize the resource name being referenced.

 A module is an easy way to organize our configuration management tools.
 
 The catalog is the list of rules for each individual system generated once the server has evaluated all variables, 
 conditionals, and functionals in the manifest and then compared them with facts for each system.  
 
 New functions added after installing a new module can be found in the lib folder in the directory of the new module.  
 /usr/share/puppet/modules.available/puppetlabs-apache/lib
 
 Manifest files for Puppet will end in the extension .pp
 
 Metadata is data about data, and in this case, often takes the form of installation and compatibility information.
 
 When defining resource types, we write them in lowercase, then capitalize them when referring to them from another resource attribute.
 
 Node Defintions - Different kinds of nodes are defined, allowing different sets of rule catalogs to apply to different types of machines.
 
 The CA either queues a certificate request for manual validation, or uses pre-shared data to verify before sending the certificate to the agent.
 The Certificate Authority creates an SSL key for the agent machine and creates a certificate request.
 
 A FQDN is a complete domain name for a specific machine that contains both the hostname and the domain name.  
 A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the unabbreviated name for a particular computer, or server. 
 There are two elements of the FQDN: the hostname and the domain name.
 
 When a Puppet agent evaluates the state of each component in the manifest, it uses gathered facts about the system to decide which rules to apply. 
 templates  can these facts be "plugged into" in order to simplify management of the content of our Puppet configuration files
 
 Templates are documents that combine code, system facts, and text to render a configuration output fitting predefined rules.  
 
 Puppet uses an Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Public Key Infrastructure to authenticate both nodes and masters.
